  KISS Modes are selected automatically acccording the KISS frame size.
  Allows you to send APRS Position Messages in Speed level 1 with low power, using any APRS app with a KISS Port (PinPoint, APRSDroid, APRSIS32...) 
  Also useful to send short CQ and Broadcast messages with VarAC

  With Encryption connections, prevents them from Winlink double session when two stations call to the same sation at the same time.
  This will be true only if all the stations update to v4.8.2 For non-Encryption connections, this was already fixed since v4.5.5

  Independent detection of missing input/output soundcard devices
  

v4.8.1  (01/01/2024)

  New commands: "WINLINK SESSION" and "P2P SESSION"  (Client Station-->VARA)

  "WINLINK SESSION" command  (By default)
     VARA send retries following a 4.0 seconds cycle, necessary to connect with the RMS Gateways (DWELL time 4s)

  "P2P SESSION" command
     Set the retrie cycle to 4.6 seconds to allow connecting two SDR's at maximum latency (worst case)
     This command must be used for P2P connections, not for Gateways connections.

  Integrated Syslog Client (only for VARA registered stations):
    Syslog is a standard for message logging developed in the 1980s by Eric Allman.
    It can used for remote VARA RMS Gateways diagnosis in real time.
    You will need to install a Syslog Server. I am using "Syslog Watcher":  https://ezfive.com/syslog-watcher/


v4.5.5  (09/01/2022)

  Avoid "finite" BREAK Loops when the Winlink Server data flux fails.

  This will be true only if all the stations update to v4.5.5

  Timing improvements

  Send the HF Bandwith (500,2300,2750) in the CONNECTED command

  Plug & Play facility for the RA-Board interface

  New command CHAT ON/OFF (Temporary, "CHAT ON" and "LISTEN CQ" are the same). By default is "CHAT OFF"
 
  "CHAT ON" command: 
    - Optimizes VARA timing for using with chat type apps like VARA Chat, VarAC, Varim ....
    - Listen CQ Frames
    - Support high latency to connect two FlexRadio's: SDR<->SDR
    - Infinite Idle loop. Allows both stations to be in sync forever, until the path dies
    - Send the SN command for each data block received.
    - Optimize the handover interchange for keyboard to keyboard.
    - This command should not be used with Winlink or B2F protocol apps.
    - Includes the LISTEN ON command

  "CHAT OFF" command: 
    - Optimize the handover interchange for Winlink, B2F protocol, BBS, etc...
    - Limited Idle Loops. Avoid the stations stay connected forever in a loop.
    - Latency limited according Trimode Scan time of 4 seconds. Only one Flexradio can be used in the link: SDR<->Analog Rig or Analog Rig<->SDR

   "MISSING SOUNDCARD" command:
    - This command is sent from VARA to the external application when the USB Soundcard driver has crashed (typically due to RF or high SWR on low bands) 
    - The only way to recovery the driver is restarting the PC. This task is for the external application. 
     


v4.5.0  (09/12/2021)

  PTT Menu available when the KISS Interface is connected.

  Enable both VARA Chat and APRS app in a same VARA stance. In this case the PTT switching is done by VARA Chat

  Send S/N information to VarAC (HF Chat)


v4.4.9  (05/11/2021)

  KISS Interface. Useful for APRS over VARA HF

  Compatible with the new CQ function in VARA Chat v1.2.7

  Fixed overlapping during the VARA Chat operation


v4.4.6  (01/09/2021)

  Prevent abrupt disconnect when using the express "review messages first" feature, and the operator take too much time selecting the messages.


v4.4.5  (03/08/2021)

  Less Idle CPU Usage in Gateway stations, as compatibility with old 16-bit hash versions have been definitevely removed.

  Compatibility with new Trimode versions.
  

v4.4.3  (10/04/2021)

  VARA Compression added, which reduce connect overhead for weak signal conditions. 
  Averaged simulation runs showed improvements of a factor of 2 in the Speed Level 1. 
  The improvement becomes more modest as the SNR is improved (until Speed Level 6). 
  Messages which already have Winlink applied B2F compression are not compressed.

  Compression also accelerates dramatically the BBS throughput (using VARA Terminal v1.1.5)
  Thus, BBS Lists are accelerated by 3.0, Forecast messages by 2.6 and MARS Encrypted Data by 1.5

  This great feature is active only for registered users

  The previous release version of VARA uses a 16-bit hash to resolve the callsign and this has a small but finite chance of getting the call wrong (One in 6553 error rate). 
  John Wiseman detected and reported a case he observed this happening. 
  Now this is changed to a 32-bit representation which will essentially eliminate the chance of this happening. 
  

v4.4.2  (19/03/2021)

  Fixed Compression Command compatibility with Winlink Express 


v4.4.1  (13/03/2021)
   
   Fixed problem with Trimode scanning frequencies
   Less latency in high speed levels


v4.4.0  (26/02/2021)
   
   Compatibility with future changes in the next VARA version
   Necessary sysops update this v4.4.0 as soon as be possible, before releasing the next VARA version with important innovations.

   Fixed BREAK loop in case of CMS connection failure in the middle of a VARA connection.
